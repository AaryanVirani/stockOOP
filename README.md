# Object Oriented Programming - Final Project

# IMPORTANT:
  To read through the code of the program without it showing errors, download the respective `JAR` files 
  present in the folder and add them to your external library section of your IDE. This program uses
  `JFreeChart` and `JCommon` which are not present within the native build of Java. 

  In addition, for background image, open `JAR` file within project folder. Program will still work if `JAR` file outside,
  but to have a background, open the executable `stockOOP.jar` file within the project folder.

# Project Description:
  This project will simulate a stock market for the user, enabling them to participate in stock
  market actions including buying and selling stocks. The stocks the user will be interacting with
  will be simulated (i.e. not real stocks with real-time data). At the same time, the value of the
  stocks will change depending on various factors including the user’s actions, each stock’s value
  relative to their competitors, as well as randomized events that will impact the stock market as a
  whole. The purpose of the project is to educate people about the stock market.

# Considerations
  - Limited to only 3 stocks
  - Timeline starts upon the first opening of the application and continues forward from there
    until user exits program.

# Usage
  Run the `stockOOP.jar` file in the folder. Run it within the folder to get the background (not necessary, but 
  will prove to be a better experience)
